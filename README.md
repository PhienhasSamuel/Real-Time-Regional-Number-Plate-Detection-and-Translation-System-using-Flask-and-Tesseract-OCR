# Real-Time-Regional-Number-Plate-Detection-and-Translation-System-using-Flask-and-Tesseract-OCR
A real-time vehicle number plate detection system that uses OCR to extract text in Tamil or Hindi and translates it into English. The Flask-based web dashboard displays the captured image, original text, translated result, and timestamp for monitoring and record-keeping.

# Vehicle Number Plate Detection and Translation (Tamil & Hindi)

This project is a real-time vehicle number plate recognition system designed for Indian regional languages like Tamil and Hindi. It uses a webcam to capture number plates, performs OCR using Tesseract, translates regional scripts into English, and displays the original and translated text on a web dashboard using Flask.
